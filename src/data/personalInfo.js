   bio: 'My name is Christopher Wiles and I am a full-stack Web Application Developer and , currently living in Austin, TX. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; along with inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I am both driven and self-motivated, and I am constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very passionate about Web Development, and strive to better myself as a developer, and the development community as a whole.',
