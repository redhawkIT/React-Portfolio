   bio: 'My name is Christopher Wiles, and I am a full-stack Web Application Developer currently living in Austin, TX. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with the JavaScript ecosystem and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I am driven and self-motivated, and constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am passionate about Web Development and strive to better myself as a developer, and the community as a whole.',
